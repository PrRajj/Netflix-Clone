        The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give parents control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows and films in their own space.

Kids profiles come with PIN-protected parental controls that let you restrict the maturity rating of content kids can watch and block specific titles you don’t want kids to see.
